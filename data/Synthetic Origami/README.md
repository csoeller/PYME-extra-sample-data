# 2D synthetic DNA origami (6 die face) DNA-PAINT data set #

This is a region from a DNA-PAINT Origami data set. We include a recipe (YAML file) that corrects for drift using the fiducial present in the data. Events are coalesced and non-specific events (based on a temporal filter) are removed. Finally a filtered region of interest (select data source ROI) has been created to peruse.


# Sample and acquisition information: #

1'Ab: N/A

2'Ab: N/A

Type: DNA-PAINT (D1 sequence)

Buffer: 600 mM NaCl in PBS (pH=8.0). 2 nM ATTO 655 (P1) imager sequence.

Camera: ZYLA-4.2-CL10 (Andor sCMOS)
