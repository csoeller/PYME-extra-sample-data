### Notes

3D using biplane mode via inserting a 2m lens into a splitter device to create ~250nm z shift. 

### Supplied recipe

Recipe 'fiducial_driftcorrection recipe.yaml' uses fiducial based drift correction and assignes the correct protein to the respective frames, using the "TimedSpecies" module.

Notebook included merges the single binding events that were localised within a radius of 2.0x the localisation error and were on for a consecutive number of 5 frames. It then plots the "coalesced" events.
