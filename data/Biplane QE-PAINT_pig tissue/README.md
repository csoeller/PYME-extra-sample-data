### Notes



### Supplied recipe

Recipe included uses fiducial based drift correction and assignes the correct protein to the respective frames, using the "TimedSpecies" module.

Notebook included merges the single binding events that were localised within a radius of 2.0x the localisation error and were on for a consecutive number of 5 frames. It then plots the "coalesced" events.
