# Biplane Quencher-Exchange PAINT 
## sample: Pig cardiac ventricular tissue
### staining: RyR2 - IP3R2 - Imager ATTO 655

Data: 8.10.19 series C 

Imaging round 1: IP3R2 t=30-50.6k frames
Imaging round 2: RyR2 t=54.3k-80.7k frames

### ******On the DataPipeline under the FilterTable, change the A maximum value. A fiducial marker will now be included, and you can load the recipe to correct for the drift using fiducial drift correction******

Recipe included uses fiducial based drift correction and assignes the correct protein to the respective frames, using the "TimedSpecies" module.
