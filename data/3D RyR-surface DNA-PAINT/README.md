# 3D (biplane) surface RyR DNA-PAINT data set #

This is a region from a DNA-PAINT RyR data set. We include a recipe (YAML file) that corrects for drift using the fiducial present in the data. A final module selects for a region of interest (select data source ROI).  

# Sample and acquisition information: #

1'Ab: RyR (MA3-916)

2'Ab: goat anti-mouse with 9bp (P5) functionalized docking sequences present.

Type: DNA-PAINT

Buffer: 500 mM NaCl in PBS (pH=8.0). 1 nM ATTO 655 (P5) imager sequence.

Camera: DU897_BV (Andor iXon DV97)

Integration time:  100 ms

Total duration (frames): 76.8k
 
Additional Information: 50/50 beam splitter. 3 m len in short path. Shift corrected prior to imaging using a densely populated bead slide and calculated with a shiftfield. PSF obtained from beads in the sample.
