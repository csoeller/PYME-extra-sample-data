# MT STORM data set #

This is a STORM microtubule data set. We include a recipe (YAML file)
that includes some basic drift correction.

## ToDo

1. The drift correction is currently based on one of our non-free
   modules . It should be possible to replace this with a general
   linear (and/or piecewise linear) drift correction module that takes
   pre-determined parameter values that are just statically stored in
   the recipe.

2. Alex who I think took this series could add a bit more info about
   it.
