# PICASSO simulation data set #

This is a data set of localisations generated `picasso simulate`. It
simulates some simple DNA origami imaged with DNA PAINT.

## ToDo

Need to add a bit more detail about the simulation. Most of it is in
principle retrievable from the YMAL file that accompanies it which has
some metadata.

How to retrieve that info is indicated in the notebook that processes
this data.
