# Example data (and a little code) for PYME localisation data handling

This repo aims to collect PYME localisation data examples and some useful
code tidbits.

For details about the PYthon Microscopy Environment (PYME) please
refer to <https://python-microscopy.org>.

## Structure

There is a data subtree with example data from various sources. We
will strive to document a little about the origin of the data in
readme files in the respective directories.

We also intend to maintain some example code how to convert, access
and manipulate the example data. These should also serve as reminders
how to programmatically access SMLM data files outside the VisGUI
graphical application. This is a useful mode for power users and also
has the great advantage to be able to _replay_ an action without the
clicking and selecting functionality in the GUI. 

Needless to say, this will likely remain a _work in progress_.
